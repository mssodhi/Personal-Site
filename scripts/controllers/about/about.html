            <h3>I am a fourth year student studying Computer Science at University of
                California, Davis. I am currently working at Risk and Safety Services (formerly IT Services) developing applications for use across multiple University
                of California campuses. I hope to graduate and work full time as a software developer while I pursue my goals of
